w1-w2:
Before I start again, I would not want to modify my previous CCI Trend Following strategy into a short term mean reversion strategy by directly adjusting the parameters, although technically this is entirely feasible. This is because even if it were possible, it might be theoretically difficult to explain, for example, why would you use the CCI indicator in a short-term strategy when it is more suited to a long-term indicator in many cases? So I decided to do some research on this first.

Short-term trading focuses on the fluctuating price action of a financial instrument for quick profits, whereas long-term trading focuses on more fundamental aspects and aims to make steady returns over a longer timeframe. Therefore, short-term trading is seen as a more speculative investment type rather than a traditional buy and hold approach.

Strategy ideas
1. Day trading
    Buy and sell multiple instruments throughout the day with the aim of closing out positions before the market shuts    
    Features: Can be used for any asset class or financial market; Avoid slippage; Don't need lots of indicators, only focus on price
    Stop loss: Consider the previous day's low and high price: yesterday's high marked the point where sentiment changed and the sellers came back into the market, pushing the price lower.

2. Swing trading
Swing traders focus on taking a position within a larger move, which could last several days or weeks. It is the longest style of short-term trading, as it takes advantage of medium-term movements too. Swing traders will attempt to spot a trend and capitalise on the rises and falls within the overall price movement. They will often rely on technical analysis to identify the entry and exit points for each trade.

Questions:
1.Does a daily trading strategy mean that I have to trade every day? Or does it also require a condition before proceeding, and I trend for a short-period?
The idea of day trading may suggest that traders need to trade every day, but I think this idea of trading may not be suitable for our project as we can only set the trading strategy for the next day on a daily basis. As the number of trades is very limited, this strategy does not guarantee that the position will be cleared at the close.

2. Slippage?
20% overnight gap. This would seem to make day trading very attractive, but for the same reason as above, we cannot use this strategy.

3. Will RSI and stochastic oscillator perform well in short-term trading?
The RSI compares the relative strength or weakness of a stock compared to other stocks in the market. The stochastic oscillator is used to decide whether a stock is expensive or cheap based on the stock's closing price range over a period of time. (Maybe these two can used to help with the Bollinger Band Squeeze strategy)

Possible strategies in order of priority, if the results are not good I will try next one
1. Bollinger Band Squeeze

According to this research (Short Term Trading Models â€“ Mean Reversion Trading Strategies and the Black Swan Events, https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3538891), Bollinger Bands alone cannot be considered a sign for buy or sell signals, they just show when the asset is overbought or oversold. 
Q4: What is the difference between trading in overbought and oversold areas and trading in non-overbought and non-oversold areas in a short-term strategy?

2. 2-period RSI strategy

3. My existing CCI Trend Following 
Change the CCI indicator to RSI indicator or something else

Use market orders to trade when appropriate and use limit orders to cut losses.

Patterns (considerable):
1. Head and Shoulders

4. Double Bottoms

Update 16 Feb 2022: Zhangyuan Xu suddenly claims to have changed his strategy to short-term mean reversion. For diversity reasons, I have to re-enable the previous CCI Mean reversion strategy.

Now I have to go back to my previous CCI Trend Following Strategy. 
First of all, I need to update my trading conditions, because when I implemented this strategy last semester, due to time issues, it was semi-finished. To be specific, I had previously only set up a trade between two CCI indicator lines, but did not consider how the CCI value crossed the two lines (i.e. whether it crossed from above or below). This obviously poses a risk of loss. To solve this problem, I set up a variable cciYesterday, where I can combine the two days of cci values to determine the crossover pattern.
