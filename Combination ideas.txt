Zheyu's momentum strategy has the highest priority, that is, when his strategy is running, other people's strategies will not operate even if they are triggered (assuming his strategy is credible enough). Tianyi's strategy based on the cci indicator is a long-term strategy, which tries to find a low price in the oversold zone and go long, and go short in the overbought zone. Since this strategy is similar to Zhangyuan's, we need to find a way to cooperate. For specific methods, please refer to Tianyi's idea of visualizing the trading behavior of each strategy with visual charts in the last meeting. Other than that, Kechen's strategy may be a good way to find price lows and can be easily combined with Tianyi's and Zhangyuan's strategies.
